# Code for Code Location Server in Dagster
This is a demo for using Dagster with SQL Server and Kerberos setup.
The main purpose is to make it work, as im not a dagster developer. To make it work, test your own SQL server and sql statements and correct the assest file

## Example
1. It connect to a SQL DAtabase with "Trusted_Connection=yes;TrustServerCertificate=yes".
2. I recommend to test it first using user/pass in dev environments.
